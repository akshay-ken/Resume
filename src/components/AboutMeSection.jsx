        am a <b>26-year-old college dropout</b> living in Navi Mumbai. I dropped
        out of college in 2018 due to financial challenges and began working in
        the desktop repair field. From 2019 to 2023, I accumulated approximately
        2 years of experience amid tough COVID disruptions. lockdowns forced
        multiple job changes as companies closed down or shifted entirely
        online, leading to instability and periods of unemployment. From 2023 to
        2025, I took on part-time roles at local food marts for stability while
        beginning to explore web development in 2024. In 2025, I fully committed
        to self-study and hands-on practice.
